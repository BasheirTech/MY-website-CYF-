  <p>The iPhone 17, announced by Apple in September 2025, brings a number of upgrades and new features over its predecessors. It features a 6.3‑inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with ProMotion technology, offering a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and peak outdoor brightness up to 3,000 nits. The screen also supports Always‑On functionality, making it more convenient for glancing at important info.</p>

  <p>The design includes an aluminum frame and upgraded Ceramic Shield 2 front glass with improved scratch resistance and anti-reflective coating. It comes in new colors like Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, and Lavender.</p>

  <p>Camera upgrades are notable — the dual rear system includes two 48MP lenses. One acts as a wide lens with 2x optical-quality zoom via cropping, and the other is an ultra-wide. The front-facing camera is now 18MP with a square sensor and Center Stage support for better framing during calls or selfies.</p>
